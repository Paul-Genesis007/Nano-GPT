# Text Processing Model

## Overview
This repository provides a Python script (`model.py`) for processing and analyzing text data.  
It comes with an example input file (`input.txt`) containing excerpts from *Coriolanus* by William Shakespeare.  

The goal is to demonstrate how to handle raw text data, run it through a model/script, and generate useful results.
